### What It Does
This is a website where you can compete against other users in the server. By clicking a button its corresponding rectangle will grow in size.
There are three teams; red, blue, and green. The team that reaches 100 clicks the first is greeted by a victory screen, signifying the end of the contest.
### How it works
Utilizing html and javascript, mouse clicks on the button are communicated through to increment the count and the column height simutaneously.

Pain. Lots of it.
